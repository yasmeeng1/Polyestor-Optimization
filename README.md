The code takes H&M and competitiors' current polyester percentages and prices as input. 
It calculates how much H&M could increase its polyester use to lower prices, aiming for a midpoint between H&M's current price and the competitor's price. 
It then outputs the suggested polyester percentage for H&M and the estimated new price. 
Essentially, it's finding a balance between using more polyester to reduce costs and maintaining a price advantage over their competitiors.
